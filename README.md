It was quite hard to create a normal and stable app in 3 hours. I know that there are a lot of mistakes and scumcode. I would fix it if I had more time. In some of such places I wrote TODO.

UPD. I corrected some bad places in my code.
Unfortunately I don't remember request's type to change a table (name or participants), that's why I didn't implement it.
